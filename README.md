Meltdown and Spectre .. for normal people
==========================================

_Meltdown_ and _Spectre_ are security flaws that gained widespread media coverage in the first days of 2018. 
Most coverages of these flaws fall either into the category "Intel caused a terrible security bug, all hope is lost!" (AKA _we are going to die!_)  or "By priming the BPU of the CPU a malicious process can read out of bounds memory via speculative code execution" (AKA _white noise_ to most people). With these slides I fill the hole between _we are going to die!_ and _white noise_. 

Contrary to other security bugs these flaws are
- hardware, not software based
- the direct consequence of years of performance improvements
- extremely widespread because they affect (nearly all) computer systems, including mobile phones

## How these slides are different

This is for "normal people". With these slides I fill the hole between _we are going to die!_ and _white noise_. You, the reader, will understand _what_ went wrong,  _how_ it went wrong, and _why_ this is bad. I will try to minimise the computer specialists words to an absolute minimum. Promised!
